      'A search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until it finds the target or reaches the end. It is the simplest search method and works on any list, sorted or not.',
    whatFor:
      'Linear search is used to find whether a value exists in a collection (array, list) and, if so, at which index. It is the go-to when the data is unsorted or when you need to find a single occurrence.',
    bestUseCase:
      'Best for small or unsorted data. It is ideal when you rarely search (so sorting would not pay off), when the list is small (e.g. under a few dozen elements), or when you need a simple, correct implementation without extra memory. It also works when the list is already sorted but you do not want to maintain a more complex structure.',
    performance:
      'It is simple but not fast on large data: in the worst case it checks every element (O(n)). It can be fast when the target is near the start (best case O(1)). There is no extra memory beyond a few variables (O(1) space). For large or frequently searched data, consider binary search (on sorted data) or a hash set for lookups.',
